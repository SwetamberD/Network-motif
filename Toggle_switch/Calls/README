# Network-motif/Toggle_switch

Toggle model
Last modified on April 11, 2020.

(Please contact for further information and preprint of the paper)

The model has been defined in our paper entitled "Tunability enhancement of 
gene regulatory motifs through competition for regulatory protein resources" 
(currently under review).

This folder contains scripts written in python which generate the results for
the toggle switch reported in the paper.

1. Basin_attraction_variation_with_Np_Nd.py
   this code computes separatrices for different Np's and Nd's

2. Plot_basin_of_attraction_Nps_Nds.py
   this code plots the data computed and regenerates the Figs. 4(A) and 4(C).

3. Nulc_lines_plotter.py
   this code plots he nulc lines (Fig. 3B).

4. Time_evolution_model.py
   this codes solves the model and plots its time evolution. Use this to
   reproduce Figs. 3(C), 4(B), and 4(D).

5. Basin_attraction_for_binding_affinities.py
   this code computes separatrices for various binding affinites (for SI).

6.  Plot_basin_of_attraction_binding_affinity.py
    this codes reproduces the plot in SI Fig 1(B).
