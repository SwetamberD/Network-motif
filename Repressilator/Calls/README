# Network-motif/Repressilator

Repressilator

(Please contact for further information and preprint of the paper)

The model has been defined in our paper entitled "Tunability enhancement of 
gene regulatory motifs through competition for regulatory protein resources" 
(currently under review).

This folder contains scripts written in python which generate the results for
the repressilator reported in the paper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. solve_model_with_decoys.py  
   this code solves the model and plots the time evolution reproducing Figs. 
   5(C) and 5(D). 

2. Stability_diagram_Np_Nd.py
   this codes generates the stability daigram (Fig. 5 (B)).

3. Hopf_freq_Np_Nd.py
   this codes generates th results of Hopf frequency computation and reproduces 
   plot in Fig. 6(A).

4. Amplitude_ratio.py
   this code computes and plots the amplitude ratios (Fig. 6(B)).

5. Amp_varying_vs_decoy_for_Np_1.py
   this code computes and plots the amplitude ratio for varying binding
   affinities (SI Fig. 1(C)).
