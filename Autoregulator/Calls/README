Auto regulation model

(Please contact for further information and preprint of the paper)

The model has been defined in our paper entitled "Tunability enhancement of 
gene regulatory motifs through competition for regulatory protein resources" 
(currently under review).

This folder contains scripts written in python which generate the results 
reported in the paper.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Auto_reg.py - 
this code generates time evolution of the motif at the given set of parameters.
 In particular, it produces the plot in Fig. 2(A) in the paper.
--
2. Half_times_Nps_Nd_0.py and Half_times_computations_Nps_Nds.py -
these codes compute half-times to reach steady states for a given
gene copy numbers and decoy sites and generates data for the plots in Fig 2(B) 
and Fig 1(A) in the accompanying supplementary text.
--
3. Plot_half_times_Nps_Nd_0.py and Plot_half_times.py - 
these scripts produce the plots in Fig 2(B) and Fig 1(A) in the accompanying 
supplementary text.
